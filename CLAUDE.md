# Pigeon Park

Pigeon Park is a browser game about breeding pigeons.

## Task
Port the prototype to an engine that supports better performance and better graphics. See the "How Claude works on this project" for some guidance. The end state is a browser game that looks good, is fun, and easy to play or to let run on its own. It should work on mobile or desktop devices. It is okay to look whimsical or animated and does not need to be too realistic, but the quality should be better than the prototype.

# 1. Prototype
A prototype is built as a Design Component (prototype/pigeon-park.html. Progress saves to localStorage.

## Core loop

The birds breed on their own: they wander, court, lay eggs and hatch chicks. There's no click-to-breed.
The player shapes the gene pool by favoriting birds (cloning them) and dismissing others.
The park holds 45 birds. Dragging a bird into the Roost zone keeps it safe.
Real breeds appear when the right genes come together, and each one unlocks in the Breed Registry. The Registry has clone buttons for breeds you've found.

## Genetics (genetics.js)

About 23 genes, each with ranked dominant/recessive variants, modeled on real pigeon genetics: base color, spread, dilute, pattern, pied, crest, tail, muffs, mane, frill, size, eye and more. Fantasy colors (gold, mint, lilac, bubblegum, void, diamond, emerald, 7 ore types, mixed gemstone) only appear through mutation and are recessive. A bird needs two copies to show them, so breeding carriers is the only way to get them. Rare accessories (hats, monocles) appear as random mutations.
The Breed Registry has 31 breeds:
Real fancy breeds: Fantail, Jacobin, Modena, Indian Fantail, Oriental Frill, Brunner Pouter, Damascene and others.
Exotic breeds: Nicobar Pigeon (rainbow neck feathers, white tail), Victoria Crowned Pigeon (lace crown, very large), Luzon Bleeding-heart (white with a red heart on the breast).
6 absurd cryptids.
Each breed has a sample look so registry specimens and clones match the real bird.
Pigeonpedia holds a funny field note for every trait.
Sprites (sprites.js)

Each pigeon is drawn as an SVG from its traits.
Very large birds show at about 1.4× and very small ones at about 0.7×. Each genome also has a slight fixed size difference (±8%), so clones match.
Features

Day/night cycle, synth coos, sparkles on rare birds, cosmetic poop and absurd auto-generated names.
Park speed (Stroll to Frantic) and Mutation rate (Calm to Chaos) settings, both saved.
Each bird's position, facing direction and the time of day are saved, so a restart picks up where it left off.
Autosave is blocked until the flock has loaded, so an empty park can't overwrite a good save.

## Cheat codes (type them in the park)

rizz: spawns the legendary Void and Galaxy pigeons.
ore: spawns 11 pigeons: Diamond, Emerald, Gold, Mixed Gemstone, and Gold, Diamond, Emerald, Redstone, Iron, Lapis and Coal Ore. The ore birds are stone-grey with blocky colored flecks.
Status: The game has everything in the original brief, and the standalone export includes all the latest changes. After any change to the Design Component, regenerate the export.




# 2. How Claude works on this project

### 2.1 Everything is text; close the loop yourself
- Prefer code, scene files, configs and scripts you can read and diff over editor clicks. If a change can be made by editing a file, do that instead of driving an inspector.
- Never act blind for more than one step. After every change that affects what the player sees, capture a frame (or a short frame sequence for motion) from a named camera and look at it before the next change. After every change that affects behaviour, read numbers from game state, not pixels.
- Post the picture, not a description of it. Every meaningful pass ends with an in-engine capture attached to the update, shot through the real player path (not a dev harness dressed differently), captioned with what changed.
- Always say what is verified and what isn't ("two local clients verified; real-network multiplayer not tested with humans").

### 2.2 Build the debug hooks first (day 1, before content)
Expose these behind a dev flag / URL param / editor menu, and keep them working for the life of the project:
- `teleport(x,y,z | namedSpot)`, `freeze() / step(n) / resume()`, `setTimeOfDay(h)`, `setSeed(n)`, `spawn(kind, at)`, `clearAll()`, `win() / lose()`.
- Named fixed cameras — `cam("overview")`, `cam("hero-close")`, `cam("hud-check")` — so before/after shots are comparable.
- `getState()` → a JSON snapshot of everything gameplay-relevant: positions, velocities, health, score, round phase, entity counts, current level id, frame ms, draw calls, shader-program count, GPU/renderer string, context-lost flag.
- A deterministic mode: fixed timestep, seeded RNG, optional `simdt` override so scripted runs replay identically.
- An on-screen diagnostics overlay (GPU string, frame ms, draw calls, last shader error) that also works on a phone.

### 2.3 Check behaviour with numbers, check looks with pictures
- Write assertions against `getState()`: "after holding W for 2 s, speed > 8"; "a novice bot finishes lap 1 with 0 respawns"; "every quest objective resolves to a placed world position"; "shader-program count is constant from the first title frame".
- Sweep input *combinations* (W+A at full steer), not single axes. Exercise the real input→intent path at least once per feature, not only injected intents — dead input paths pass sim-level tests.
- Run a stills sweep over *every* level/biome/stage enumerated from the game's own registry (never a hand-picked subset); fail on any blank frame (mean luma ≈ 0 or < 2 % pixel variance) or console error.
- Take at least one composited full-window screenshot through the true cold-boot path (cleared storage, no dev flags). Canvas read-backs don't see a DOM/UI overlay left covering the screen; players do.
- Content probes beat playthroughs for coverage: check data (spawn tables, objectives, nav links) resolves before checking it plays.

### 2.4 Iteration cadence
- Small diffs, one concern each. Before calling anything done — including a one-line hotfix — boot the game headless for ~10 s and assert sim time advances with no console errors.
- Playtest the first five minutes before building breadth: ship the intro + one level, get a human read, then widen.
- Environment before hero asset; art pass before netcode polish; textures last.
- Make low-stakes design calls yourself and report them in one line ("went with X — say if you'd rather Y"). Stop and ask only for irreversible or direction-setting choices.
- Commit early and often with explicit paths; keep `notes/progress.md` current enough that a cold reader could resume.

### 2.5 Definition of done (every iteration)
- [ ] Boots cold with no console errors; sim time advances.
- [ ] The change is visible in an attached capture from a named camera (before/after if visual).
- [ ] A `getState()` assertion covers the behaviour touched, and it passes.
- [ ] Frame ms and draw calls within the Section 1 budget on the reference tier; program/light count unchanged unless intended.
- [ ] Real input path exercised (real mouse/touch coordinates, not synthetic events).
- [ ] Notes updated: what changed, verified vs not, what's next.

### 2.6 When stuck
- Two failed attempts at the same fix → stop patching and instrument: add the state field, counter or overlay that would have made the cause obvious, then look again.
- Symptom lookup: "black screen" → check UI/DOM overlays before the GPU. "White 3D view, HUD still works" on Android → lost graphics context. "Freezes the first time only" → shader recompiles (see 3.3). "Flickering textures" → coplanar geometry z-fighting. "Shadows vanished" → diff one frozen frame shadows on/off, then check boot-time quality config. "Player teleports after a stall" → uncapped fixed-step catch-up.
- If a reference or asset source is unreachable, ask for pasted screenshots; don't guess the look.
- If the ask is "photoreal / AAA", state the honest ceiling in the first reply (procedural + scripted-DCC assets top out around clean, slightly stylised realism, convincing at walking pace — not scan quality) and pitch two bold stylised directions alongside. Stylised-and-confident beats almost-realistic every time.

## 3. Craft defaults (apply unless Section 1 overrides)

### 3.1 Look-dev floor
- Decide the look before building: sun direction + time of day (never noon), the palette, one material rule (toon + hull outline / cel + ink / gradient atlas / matte clay / textured PBR), three refusals. Styles that replace light transport with graphic design (ink, paper, clay, toy, vector, clean low-poly) succeed with procedural assets; styles that merely filter a realistic render inherit its sameness.
- Lighting floor: hemisphere/sky ambient (not flat ambient) + one directional sun with its shadow frustum *fitted to the play area* (cascades beyond ~60 m), small normal bias (~0.03), every mesh casts and receives, analytic sky with fog matched to the horizon colour, filmic/ACES tonemapping at one fixed exposure, ambient occlusion at a world-space radius (~2 m) or baked AO. With physically based units: sun ≈ 3–4, sky ≈ 0.6–1.
- The "looks cheap" tells, in order of payoff to fix: no contact shadow/AO; single-colour ground (give it two frequencies — macro tint + ruts/decals/scatter); flat horizon into a gradient sky (add haze and distant silhouettes); primitive secondary assets (no cone pines, sphere trees, capsule crowds); uniform specular; a hero-vs-environment quality gap. Fitted shadows and real silhouettes buy more than any texture or post effect.
- Never grainy: no film grain, sharpen or chromatic aberration; denoised AO; MSAA or temporal AA; soft shadows; gentle bloom; true blacks and no blown whites. Never show frames with stand-in noise textures on large surfaces — clean flat materials until real ones land.
- Textures last and never 1:1 from a catalogue: tint × subtle albedo with real normal/roughness, world-metre tiling with a large-scale two-set blend to kill repetition, metallic off on dielectrics. Naively applied photo textures look worse than none.
- Render at `min(devicePixelRatio, 2)` with AA; capping pixel ratio at 1.25–1.5 under a 2× layout makes everything soft. Deliberate low-res looks need an exact integer upscale.
- Flair is event-driven and in-world (hit-stop, impact pops, damage numbers, rim glow on the aimed target), never a constant full-screen filter or always-on speed lines.

### 3.2 Game feel + UX
- Arcade-forgiving by default: assists on, soft wall collisions, generous checkpoints/gates, bots near novice pace; sim handling is opt-in. Gate: a novice proxy (250 ms reaction, no braking) completes the first lap/level without a respawn.
- Third-person action/party games: close chase cam (≈ 8 back, 4 up, FOV ~45) that swings behind travel with frame-rate-independent smoothing; active verbs on dedicated keys (jump, dive/dodge, shove/grab); telegraphed hazards that force those verbs; short auto-starting rounds (45–60 s). Large position jumps *cut* the camera, never pan. A distant diorama camera with passive attrition reads as boring regardless of asset quality.
- First-person: pointer-lock mouse-look with raw deltas and a centre reticle, brisk sensitivity, never cursor-at-edge turning; retry in ≤ 3 s, skippable intros.
- Ship the trimmings from v1 on simple systems: title → one-click **Play now**; **Play with friends** (short room code + copyable link, visible player list marking humans, host-owned Bots on/off); Esc pause/settings; a scoreboard titled LEADERBOARD or HIGH SCORES; round flow; death/finish screen; audio; animation states.
- `?` (plus a pause-menu/touch entry) opens a help sheet — controls, goals, tips — generated from the game's own content/constant tables so it never drifts from the build.
- HUD type: a clean sans-serif, no text shadows or glows; solve legibility with contrast (dark ink, or thin frosted strips over bright worlds), light weights for big numerals, small tracked caps for labels.
- Touch: full-height control zones, short throw, dead-zone ≤ 0.06, no input smoothing in UI code.

### 3.3 Performance + weak GPUs
- Budgets live in Section 1; log against them every run: frame ms (p50/p99), draw calls, triangles, shader programs, texture memory, load time, download size. Ship lightweight telemetry/diagnostics so real devices tell you what broke.
- Shader warm-up: many engines key lit-material programs on the active light count, so toggling lights or spawning the first explosion recompiles everything mid-game (the classic "1 s freeze the first time, fine after"). Never change light count at runtime — pooled lights stay enabled at intensity 0. Behind the loading screen, instantiate one of every effect/material, compile, draw a real frame including the shadow pass, then return everything to pools. Assert program count stays constant after the title frame.
- Mobile: no MSAA on phones by default (on some mobile GPUs an MSAA target makes a lost context unrecoverable), basic PCF shadows, async shader compile before the first frame, a real context-lost/restored handler that rebuilds renderer + scene, and a persisted step-down ladder (shadows off → fewer lights / lower res → all low) with a "graphics reset — tap to reload" card. Some recent mobile GPUs reset on the shadow-map depth pass itself: detect them by renderer string and start with cast shadows off plus a blob/contact shadow. Desktop phone emulation reproduces none of this — test on a device.
- Per-draw CPU overhead is the mobile bottleneck: merge/instance draws; never update vertex buffers that in-flight frames still read (double-buffer or orphan); never synchronous GPU read-backs per frame or per icon (bake UI portraits/thumbnails once at boot).
- Fixed-step sim: clamp `dt ≥ 0`, cap catch-up ticks after a stall, and make watchdogs require N consecutive slow ticks rather than one long warm-up frame. Resize render targets whenever the drawing buffer changes.

### 3.4 Assets
- Default DCC is headless Blender as a Python module (`pip install bpy`, pinned to the release matching your Python version; it can segfault on interpreter *exit* after a successful export — check the output file, not the exit code). Script the model → export GLB → load in engine. Use it for bevelled hard-surface props, vehicles, set pieces, AO/lightmap bakes and beauty renders; keep stylised characters code-built unless a side-by-side says Blender wins.
- Per hero asset plan pass 1 / pass 2 / final; check the read at close-up *and* thumbnail scale; post before/after. Raise triangle budgets rather than ship box placeholders: characters get rounded forms, tapered limbs, hands, faces, layered clothing, personality in idle; props get chunky readable forms with rivets/decals.
- Try CC0 libraries (Poly Haven, ambientCG, Kenney, KayKit, Khronos sample models) before hand-authoring; verify the licence; version every asset URL (`?v=<build>`) because CDNs cache binaries as immutable. Off-the-shelf kits rarely fit a themed brief exactly — budget for adaptation.
- Hero/thumbnail shots: hide HUD, camera low and close on the subject (40–70 % of frame height), a moment with motion, one calm side for type, sim paused via debug hooks, staged through legal player placement.

## 4. Engine notes

### 4.1 Web (three.js / Babylon / PlayCanvas) — the most proven path
- Code-first suits Claude best: the whole game is text, boots in a headless browser, and screenshots + state come back in seconds. Single-file or small-bundle builds keep the loop fast.
- Drive tests with Playwright using real input — `page.mouse.click(x,y)`, `page.mouse.wheel`, `page.touchscreen.tap` at viewport coordinates — and assert `document.elementFromPoint(cx,cy) === canvas` at centre and corners. Synthetic `dispatchEvent` clicks bypass hit-testing and hide input-blocking overlays; a `pointer-events:none` container silently kills its child menus.
- Headless WebGL is a software rasteriser: absolute timings are meaningless and flap run-to-run, and NaN pixels / driver overhead never show. Gate on hardware-independent numbers (`renderer.info.programs.length`, a draw-call census, light count); poll for state instead of sleeping (a frame can take 300–1200 ms); treat "ready" as three presented frames; keep a `?nancheck` float-target probe for real devices.
- `recordVideo` of a WebGL canvas can come out blank headless; capture a screenshot sequence (~100 ms apart) and encode with ffmpeg, verifying non-blank by pixel variance.
- Two-client netcode gate without humans: two tabs on a local transport (e.g. `BroadcastChannel`) sharing the host-authoritative sim path; assert input→state round-trips both ways before every deploy.
- GLSL edits: land declaration + use together, then load the page and grep the console for compile errors — unit tests can't see shader failures.
- After deploy, fetch the live page and check a build-marker string and a changed asset's byte size before saying it's live.
